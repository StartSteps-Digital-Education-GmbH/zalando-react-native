# Device Capabilities & Native Modules

This section covers accessing device features and creating native modules in React Native.

## Topics

1. [Device Features](./01-device-features/01-device-features.md)
   - Camera access
   - Geolocation
   - Sensors
   - Permissions handling

2. [Native Modules](./02-native-modules/01-native-modules.md)
   - Module architecture
   - Bridging concepts
   - Platform-specific code
   - Performance considerations

3. [Third-Party Libraries](./03-third-party/01-third-party.md)
   - Library evaluation
   - Integration patterns
   - Maintenance
   - Security considerations

## Practice Sessions

- [Camera Implementation](./01-device-features/practice-session/01-camera.md)
- [Native Module Creation](./02-native-modules/practice-session/01-module-creation.md)
- [Library Integration](./03-third-party/practice-session/01-integration.md)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Access and use device features
- Create and use native modules
- Integrate third-party libraries
- Handle platform-specific code
- Manage permissions properly

## Security Considerations

1. Permission handling
2. Data security
3. API key management
4. Secure storage
5. Network security

## Best Practices

1. Request permissions only when needed
2. Handle feature unavailability
3. Test on multiple devices
4. Follow platform guidelines
5. Document native code
